Take this as a public alpha release.

The source is preconfigured for 68020+ machines. To build plain 68000
binaries edit the file named `config', then just say `make'. Notice that
statically linked libraries associated with the SLB are always built in
two versions (i.e. separately for 68000 and 68020).

Once eveything is built, you may say `make install' and `make libinstall'
to install everything. Before that make sure the env. variables $GNULIB
and $GNUINC point to your /usr/lib and /usr/include respectively, and
$SLBPATH points to a folder where SLB libraries reside.
