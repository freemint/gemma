To build everything do `gmake install'.

The include files will be installed in /usr/include/slb
The static modules will be installed in /usr/lib
The shared objects will be istalled in /usr/local/lib/slb

To get all this to work you also have to set the SLBPATH variable to point to that last
dorectory (e.g. setenv SLBPATH /usr/local/lib/slb in your mint.cnf file).

To check if everything is installed properly, run the test/test.app program. It should
open a movable window and there should be a possibility to open another one that can be
moved independently.

Since this version the library does not need -mshort anymore. To avoid conflicts with
previous versions I had to change the names of the shared objects, so that these would not be 
loaded by older software. This is why there's 'gemma32' and 'kernel32' now.
