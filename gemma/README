This is the gemma GEM library. It is not yet completely finished, 
though most of the functions should be already functioning. The 
unfinished part is mostly the multidialog support (the library can 
actually handle only one opened dialog box per application).

Take this as a public alpha release.

The source is preconfigured for 68020+ machines. To build plain 68000
binaries edit the file named `config', then just say `make'. Notice that
statically linked libraries associated with the SLB are always built in
two versions (i.e. separately for 68000 and 68020).

Once everything is built, the example program `przyklad.app' in the
directory usage should be ready to run (under GEM). When it works, that
means that the library is built and loaded properly, so follow the
installation instructions written inside the hypertext document.

If you want to develop programs which cooperate with the SLB, you will
also have to copy the contents of the directories include/ and lib/ into
your /usr/include and /usr/lib directories.
